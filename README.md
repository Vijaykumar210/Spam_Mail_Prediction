SPAM_MAIL_PREDICTION
1] Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed email text data, removing stopwords, special characters,
and converting text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
2] Feature Extraction: Utilized techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to
extract meaningful features from the text data, capturing word importance and relevance.
3] Model Selection: For implementation Logistic Regression was the best for evaluating such Classification
problem. The Logistic Regression model scored best performance on the dataset. 
4] Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy score to assess its ability
to correctly classify spam and non-spam emails.
5] Predictive System: Build a simple predictive system allowing users to input email content and receive
real-time predictions on the likelihood of spam.
